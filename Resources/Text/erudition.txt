Manifesto of Erudition: A Call to Direct Action Against the War Machine

I. Preamble

In the face of a world ensnared by the insidious grip of the military-industrial complex, Erudition arises as a beacon of resistance. Founded in 1992, our group recognizes that the battle for peace requires more than rhetoric and passive protest. We advocate for a proactive approach, deploying targeted, planned actions against corporations fueling the machinery of war and weapons of mass destruction. Our manifesto stands as a declaration of intent: to dismantle the foundations of the military-industrial complex and usher in an era of true global peace.

II. Objectives

Strategic Targets: Erudition identifies and targets corporations directly contributing to the military-industrial complex and the production of weapons of mass destruction. Our actions are precision-guided, focusing on disrupting the profit-driven motives that perpetuate war.

Economic Disruption: By strategically disrupting the financial support systems of the war machine, we aim to cripple the mechanisms that sustain conflict. Erudition seeks to undermine the economic foundations of war, compelling corporations to reconsider their complicity in the cycle of violence.

Information Warfare: In an era dominated by information, Erudition employs the tools of transparency and exposure. We expose the true cost of war profiteering, revealing the collusion between corporations and the military-industrial complex. Through information warfare, we empower the public to make informed choices and demand accountability.

III. Principles

Strategic Precision: Erudition's actions are not indiscriminate acts of violence but strategic, targeted strikes against entities directly contributing to the perpetuation of war. We prioritize the safety of non-combatants and strive to minimize collateral damage.

Secrecy and Anonymity: Understanding the risks associated with direct action, Erudition operates in the shadows. Our members embrace anonymity to protect themselves and ensure the continued efficacy of our operations.

Ethical Considerations: While advocating for direct action, Erudition adheres to a strict code of ethics. We recognize the gravity of our mission and strive to balance the urgency of our cause with moral considerations, always seeking to uphold principles of justice.

IV. Action

Erudition commits to direct, targeted actions against the military-industrial complex:

Corporate Sabotage: Through calculated acts of sabotage, we will disrupt the operations of corporations that fuel the military-industrial complex, rendering them incapable of contributing to the machinery of war.

Financial Warfare: Erudition will employ economic tactics, such as divestment campaigns and financial disruptions, to destabilize the financial underpinnings of corporations profiting from war.

Information Campaigns: Utilizing the power of information, Erudition will conduct campaigns to expose the true nature of corporations supporting the military-industrial complex, ensuring public awareness and condemnation.

As advocates for direct action against the forces perpetuating war, Erudition marches forward with a resolute determination to dismantle the structures that profit from human suffering. We believe in the necessity of our cause and recognize that true peace can only be achieved through the strategic dismantling of the war machine. Together, we embark on this mission, unyielding in our commitment to a world free from the shackles of war and oppression.
