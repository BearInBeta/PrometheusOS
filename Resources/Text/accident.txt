Lab accident report

It seems there was a leak in the Viridian sample. Normally this would not cause an issue as it does not affect humans. However, it seems that this sample may have been modified using the DNA of Dr Blackwood which caused his immediate death.

Note: it seems a breach attempt from VV203R happened around the time of the accident, investigation required
