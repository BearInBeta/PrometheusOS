Detective,

I apologize for having lied to you like this, but I believe it was the only way.

I feared that asking you directly to investigate the lab may have been both too dangerous and may have sounded too crazy.

However, you deserve the truth:

I told Sarah Blackwood to contact you. I heard about you before and knew that you are more than capable of uncovering the whole truth. 

Running away after the incident I did not presume that JLabs would cover it up. So I did not manage to collect enough evidence of what is happening.

However, since you're reading this, my plan has worked. Now you have all the evidence needed to expose A-Corp and JLabs.

I will contact you soon with the details. Opening this document triggered an email that should reach me soon and inform me of your address so I can contact you.

Talk to you soon

Victor Fring
