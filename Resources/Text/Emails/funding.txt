Hello Mr. Orson,

I believe that the funding you secured for Viridian research will be quite sufficient, and of course itâ€™s your ultimate right as the investor to supervise the research. I will immediately inform my research team to transfer all current research files to you for review.

I am glad to say this will be a beginning to a great partnership between our labs.

Best regards,

Dr. Nathan Bennet

Subject: Funding for Viridian Research
Hello Dr. Bennet,

After talks with our finance team I have secured an initial fund of $2,000,000 that will go directly to supporting research on the Viridian virus. However, our conditions remain the same: we require full access to the current information on the research and in the future we require use of your team to continue the research in our labs and under our supervision.

Please confirm if these conditions are satisfactory to you and I will set up a meeting to finish the signing and make it official.

I hope this will be the first step into a partnership between A-Corp and JLabs.

Kind regards,
Orson Kelly
