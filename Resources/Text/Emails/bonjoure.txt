Hello Mon Amour,

Hope this message finds its way to you amidst the charming streets of France! How's the City of Love treating you? I bet those croissants and that French coffee are nothing short of amazing.

I've been missing you around here, and the house feels a bit too quiet without you. The cats seem to be equally confused without their favorite lap to curl up on. 

I hope your seminars are going smoothly and that you're getting a chance to explore a bit in between all the work. Any new discoveries or favorite spots so far? Do tell!

Here at home, things are holding up well. Work is the usual whirlwind, and I've been keeping myself occupied with a few projects. I managed to catch up with Emily and Mark last weekend â€“ you know how they always bring out the wild stories.

Can't wait to hear all about your adventures when you get back. Until then, take care, stay safe, and know that you're missed more than you can imagine.

Sending you a baguette-sized hug and a kiss from across the miles. 

Love,
Sarah
