Hello victor

I am convinced, and will join your cause. As I told you I do not believe that JLabs is conducting unethical research, however, if providing you with information will help clear that up I'll tell you all I know.

Currently we are focusing our research on the study of viruses, in rats especially. Dr. Blackwood is theorizing that some viruses are targeting specific DNA strands within rat populations, and Dr. Nathan, our CEO is hopeful about the research.

Soon we're planning to begin research on the Viridian virus specifically, as it seems most promising.

Generally we recieve government funding for our research, and from some private pharmaceutical companies too.

Let's have a meeting soon to discuss the details.

Regards,

Dr. Barbara Sinclair
