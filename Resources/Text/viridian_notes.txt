18th April 1994: Today, I'm starting a new experiment to investigate the pathogenesis and containment strategies of the Veridian Virus, which we've designated as VERID98. This virus shows promising characteristics for further exploration, and I believe it has the potential to shed light on crucial aspects of infectious diseases. In this experiment, we will observe the virus's behavior in rat models, focusing on its transmission, symptoms, and progression. Through meticulous documentation and analysis, we aim to unravel the mysteries surrounding VERID98 and contribute to the development of effective containment measures.

25th April 1994: I have separated the rats into three groups: the Veridian-infected group, the uninfected control group, and a group infected with Quada Virus, a similar but less harmful pathogen. By comparing the symptoms and progression of the Veridian-infected rats with those of the other groups, we can gain valuable insights into the unique characteristics of VERID98. This initial setup lays the foundation for our subsequent observations and data analysis.

4th May 1994: A noteworthy observation has come to light. The rats in the Veridian group are displaying a delayed onset of symptoms compared to those infected with Quada Virus. This disparity in symptom development may indicate distinct mechanisms of pathogenesis between the two viruses. Further investigation is necessary to uncover the underlying factors contributing to this discrepancy.
----
12th May 1994: Exciting news! It appears that all the rats in the Veridian group have started developing symptoms almost simultaneously, and remarkably, the majority of these symptoms occur in conjunction with one another. This synchronized manifestation raises intriguing questions about the virus's mode of action and potential mechanisms that facilitate such rapid symptom onset. Detailed analysis and documentation will be crucial in unraveling this phenomenon.

18th May 1994: An unfortunate incident occurred over the weekend. One of the Veridian-infected rats managed to escape and inadvertently entered the cage of the uninfected control group. This unexpected event jeopardizes the integrity of the experiment, and we must repeat the procedure to ensure accurate and reliable results. 
----
25th May 1994: An intriguing observation has emerged from the failed experiment. The rats that were initially uninfected appear to develop symptoms at a faster rate compared to those initially infected with Veridian. This unexpected discrepancy hints at a potential impact of prior exposure or immune response on subsequent infection progression. Further investigation is necessary to fully understand this anomaly.

30th May 1994: I have been contemplating a fascinating hypothesis regarding the Veridian Virus. It seems plausible that the virus "scans" the DNA of the initial rats it infects, acquiring information that makes it more efficient at attacking genetically related organisms. Dr. Sinclair has confirmed that all the rats we're using are genetically related, which adds credence to this theory. This unique adaptation raises intriguing possibilities for our research and warrants further exploration.
----
4th June 1994: To delve deeper into the implications of the virus imprinting DNA information, I have requested a group of rats unrelated to the original cohort for testing. If the virus exhibits a preference for genetically related hosts, we can ascertain the extent to which it relies on preexisting genetic information for successful infection. This investigation holds significant promise for unveiling the intricacies of the Veridian Virus's transmission dynamics.
----
11th June 1994: Today, a new experiment begins, employing four distinct groups of rats. One group will be infected with Veridian, and as they display symptoms, individuals from this group will be used to infect another group of genetically related rats, as well as a group of unrelated rats. A final group will remain uninfected, serving as the control. By tracking the transmission dynamics between these groups, we aim to deepen our understanding of Veridian Virus transmission and its influence on genetically related hosts.
----
18th June 1994: The Veridian-infected group has started displaying symptoms, marking a pivotal stage in our experiment. In the coming days, we will closely observe the transmission of the virus from the initial group to the genetically related and unrelated groups. This phase of the experiment holds great potential for revealing valuable insights into the virus's ability to propagate and infect hosts with varying degrees of genetic relatedness.
----
22nd June 1994: Extraordinary news! The Veridian Virus has exhibited remarkable behavior during the transmission phase. Infected rats from the initial group transmitted the virus to the genetically related group at an accelerated rate, highlighting a clear pattern of faster infection progression. This finding strongly supports the theory that the virus utilizes host DNA information to expedite infection in genetically related hosts. This breakthrough discovery emphasizes the role of genetic relatedness in the virus's mode of action.
----
30th June 1994: As I contemplate the implications of our research, I can't help but consider the potential applications beyond our current focus. If our theory holds true, the Veridian Virus's ability to target specific DNA sequences opens up exciting possibilities for targeted therapies in human medicine. Imagine a virus engineered to attack cancer cells or combat certain diseases by precisely targeting specific genetic markers. Although speculative at this stage, the potential for medical advancements is truly awe-inspiring.
