It seems A-corp has started expirementing with Viridian on their own. I have it on good authority that they are planning on using prisoners as test subjects. If this is true then the government must be supporting them. There is no denying that the research could lead to the development of a highly dangerous and precise biological weapon. This information must not be shared with JLabs scientists, it is of the utmost importance that they remain unaware of A-Corp's research.
