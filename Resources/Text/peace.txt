Why we had to do this:

My comrades,

Today Dr. Sinclair and I are going into hiding for a long time. We have committed a crime that will haunt us maybe for the rest of our lives. However, I assure you that it was done for the safety of the world.

JLabs, Sinclair’s old workplace, was conducting research on a virus called Viridian. This virus had the ability to specifically target certain DNA strands within any life form. The scientists there believed that this research will lead to new ways of battling diseases and improving human life. However, some people had different ideas.

A-Corp is a weapon’s manufacturer that works closely with the government. They heard of the research and decided that it could have another use: targeted biological weapons.

The danger of such weapon is obvious, and the ramifications that could follow our world cannot be clearer. This needed to end.

Dr. Blackwood was the lead researcher on this project for JLabs. I do not want to go into details but suffice it to say what happened to him was the only way to stop the research, even temporarily.

It seems that JLabs have covered up the incident, however we have a plan to uncover everything.

In the event that we not see each other again after this, I want to say that I am proud of you all, and I want you to keep up the fight without us.

Peace by any means necessary.

Sincerely,

Victor Fring
